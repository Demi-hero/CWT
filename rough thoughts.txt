Model : Random Forest Model with an avg accuracy of 68% and weighted avg accuracy of 64%. This is a fine accuracy. But definatly room for improvement. 
Options for improvement: 
- Try using pre-trained Bert / Other hugging face pre-trained options
- Use a multi-layered approach. Accuracy of prediction positve (>= 4) or negative (<=3) sentiments was very high. 
And from based on there pass to another model that has been trained on the subset of positive and negative features.  


Flask API: Api can receive a Json payload of arbitary length and score. Have put a wrapper around that so the wrong data type can't be sent to the api
